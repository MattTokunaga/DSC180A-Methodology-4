### QUESTIONS
# Most interesting topic?
I think the most interesting topic I've seen so far is Linearized Optimal Transport. But that could just be because I've spent the most time trying to understand it. Wasserstein GANs also seem very interesting, but I haven't researched them enough to know exactly how optimal transport helps.
# Potential investigation?
I want to pursue some of the mathematical properties of Gromov Wasserstein. I believe my mentor mentioned that people use it despite the fact that math people have stopped researching it as much. 
# Potential change?
I wish we had agreed on a topic sooner. The topic we chose seems very interesting but I feel a bit behind on understanding even the basics of it.
# Other techniques?
As I mentioned earlier, linearized optimal transport was very interesting, so I would love to find a way to incorporate that alongside Gromov Wasserstein.
